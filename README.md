I saw the below issue at ES forum.
[how-to-convert-avro-schema-to-elastic-search-mapping](https://discuss.elastic.co/t/how-to-convert-avro-schema-to-elastic-search-mapping/114749)
So I made this project for solving it.

It has two features.
First, you can load Avro schema using Registry API
Secondly, you can convert Avro schema to Elasticsearch Mapping simplify

How to use
* ./gradlew build
* java -jar target/gs-serving-web-content-0.1.0.jar
